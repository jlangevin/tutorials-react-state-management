This project show three examples of the same component tree using thre different methods of state management: 

  * props (aka prop drilling)
  * React's new Context API
  * Redux

In practice, you may have components that you don't want so tighly coupled to your implementation.  In that case, you might mix prop drilling with Context or Redux.  You'll need to decide on the right balance for own project needs.
